## Group Activity 1

### Task 1

- public = the method/attribute is visible to the entire program
  static = the method/variable can be referenced in code without creating an instance of a certain object
  args = command line arguments, can be used to alter the way a program works
- When starting a program, a main object has not been created, so the main method needs to be static in   order to be ran.


### task 2

- Abstraction: Abstraction in coding refers to hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features through interfaces or classes. This allows for more efficient and organized code development, maintenance, and reuse.
Encapsulation: Removing access to parts of the code by making attributes/methods private.
Inheritance: Lets an object acquire the properties and methods of another object (Super/sub class)
Polymorphism: The same object can occure in your code in many forms. This means that every subclass can change the output of methods that are introduced in the super class


### task 3

- Object based programming does not include any of the four pillars of object oriented programming, while object oriented does. That makes object based programming a little more clumsy.
