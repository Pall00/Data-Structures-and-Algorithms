## Group Activity 1

### Task 1

- public = the method/attribute is visible to the entire program
  static = the method/variable can be referenced in code without creating an instance of a certain object
  args = command line arguments, can be used to alter the way a program works
- When starting a program, a main object has not been created, so the main method needs to be static in   order to be ran.


### task 2

- Abstraction: Abstraction in coding refers to hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features through interfaces or classes. This allows for more efficient and organized code development, maintenance, and reuse.
- Encapsulation: Removing access to parts of the code by making attributes/methods private.
- Inheritance: Lets an object acquire the properties and methods of another object (Super/sub class)
- Polymorphism: The same object can occure in your code in many forms. This means that every subclass can change the output of methods that are introduced in the super class


### task 3

- Object based programming does not include any of the four pillars of object oriented programming, while object oriented does. That makes object based programming a little more clumsy.

### Task 1

- ADT defines the logical form of data, while data structures implement the physical form of that same data.

### task 2

- Done

### task 3

- The code has methods for constructing a Queue, and also for dequeueing and enqueueing objects into the queue. There are also methods for checking the size of the queue, checking if the queue is empty or full, and also to peek what object is in front of the queue. The code follows the FIFO principle (First in first out)

### Task 1

- Done 
- LIFO: Last in first out, the latest thing put into the queue is the first one to get out on dequeueing.
- FIFO: First in first out, the first thing that was put into the queue is the first one to get out on dequeueing.

### task 2

- The stack contains a method for constructing a stack. There are also methods for pushing an int to the stack and popping the latest int out, and for checking the size of the stack, if the stack is empty and if its full. The popping does not remove the latest int from the array, but rather just decreases the top by one.
